# NaijaHate
A project for the creation of Hate speech dataset for the 3 major Nigerian languages
Online hate is a growing problem in Nigeria, across Africa and the world. It inflicts harm on users who are exposed to it, pollutes and disrupts online communities, and can be a precursor to serious offline harm and violence. Machine Learning Tools for automatically finding and rating the hatefulness of online content can help to address this problem, supporting content moderation efforts, social media monitoring and threat evaluation. However, at present, there is almost no hate detection tools available for any Nigerian language â€“ either in academia or industry. This means that Nigerian users of online services are more likely to not be protected against hate which can severely restrict free expression and open access. We propose addressing this problem by introducing NaijaHate the first labelled dataset for hate in 3 major languages in Nigeria, as well as baseline machine learning models for each language. Through this work, we will investigate the various cultural, linguistic and technical challenges of working across so many diverse and low-resource languages on an inherently subjective concept like hate.
