# NaijaHate: Hate Speech Detection in Nigerian Languages

## Introduction
NaijaHate is a pioneering project aimed at addressing the growing problem of online hate speech in Nigeria. This project introduces the first labeled dataset for hate speech detection in three major Nigerian languages. Our goal is to aid in content moderation, social media monitoring, and threat evaluation through machine learning tools.
