# NaijaHate: Hate Speech Detection in Nigerian Languages

## Introduction
NaijaHate is a pioneering project aimed at addressing the growing problem of online hate speech in Nigeria. This project introduces the first labeled dataset for hate speech detection in three major Nigerian languages. Our goal is to aid in content moderation, social media monitoring, and threat evaluation through machine learning tools.

## Lexicon
At the outset of the NaijaHate project, we curated hate speech lexicons for each of the major Nigerian languages. These lexicons played a crucial role in our data collection process, particularly in the collection of tweets in all the languages. The lexicons are comprehensive and tailored to the linguistic nuances of each language, ensuring effective identification of hate speech.

You can access the lexicons for all the languages in the [Lexicons folder](https://github.com/smaliyu/NaijaHate/blob/main/Data%20Sampling%20strategy_.pdf).

  
## Research Paper

We have successfully published a paper titled "xxxx" that details the methodologies, findings, and implications of our project. This paper serves as a cornerstone in our efforts to understand and combat online hate speech in Nigerian languages. Link to the published paper: [Published Paper](<link-to-published-paper>)


We are also excited to announce that we are currently working on a second paper titled "xx", which aims to build upon our initial findings and explore new dimensions of hate speech detection.


## Project Sponsors
We express our profound gratitude to Data Science Africa for their generous support in funding this project. Their commitment to advancing data science and machine learning across Africa has been instrumental in making NaijaHate a reality. This grant has enabled us to tackle the critical issue of hate speech in Nigerian languages, fostering a safer online environment.
